# Concepts
## Graph
- **Topological Sort**
  - [Kahn's Algorithm](https://mohammad-imran.medium.com/understanding-topological-sorting-with-kahns-algo-8af5a588dd0e)
  - [Plain DFS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL-KzMXSXXI)

## Queue
- **Priority Queue**
  - A Queue where all the nodes has a priority and are **sorted** by **priority**
  - A **Priority Queue** can be formed using an **Array, LinkedList and a Heap (Min or Max Heap)**
  - **Min Heap** is where the child nodes are always lesser than the parent node
  - **Max Heap** is where the child nodes are always greater than the parent node
 
## Binary Tree
- [Binary Tree Types](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-binary-tree/)
- **Special Types of Tree**
  - **Binary Search Tree**
    - Left Child Node which will lesser than Parent Node and Right Child Node which will greater than the Parent Node
